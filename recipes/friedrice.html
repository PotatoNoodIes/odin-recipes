        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Shrimp Fried Rice is one of my go-to 30-minute meals and my family can't get enough<br> 
            of it. Shrimp and rice loaded with veggies and egg is a protein-packed and easy dinner.<br> 
            Fried Rice is the best way to use leftover Cooked Rice.<br>
            <br>
            We love recreating Asian takeout dishes like Chow Mein, General Tso's Chicken, and<br> 
            of course saucy Beef and Broccoli Stir Fry. Making fried rice is probably the easiest<br> 
            homemade takeout dish.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled<br>
                 and deveined</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
            <li>½ cup frozen corn</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced, or more to<br>
                taste</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, or<br>
                more to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or<br>
                to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high<br>
                heat. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the<br>
                meat is opaque, about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li><br>
            <li>Remove shrimp from the skillet using a slotted spoon, allowing oils and cooking<br>
                juices to remain in the skillet. Place shrimp on a plate and set aside.</li><br>
            <li>Add peas and carrots and corn to the skillet and cook, stirring intermittently,<br>
                until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1<br>
                minute. Push vegetables to the side of the skillet, pour eggs into the other side,<br>
                and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary, 3 to 4 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Stir shrimp, rice, and green onions into the skillet. Drizzle evenly with soy sauce,<br>
                season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook until shrimp is reheated<br>
                through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
